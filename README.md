# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis 
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate data about ride data from company Pyber and report our findings for the CEO of the company. From there, we were able to find the total rides, total drivers, total fare, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for each city type. We could then create a graph showing total fares amount within each city type for each week from January to end of April. 

## Results 
From the multiple line graph, we can see that Rural cities received the lowest total fares from each week and that urban cities have the highest total fares from each week. I also noticed that the average fare per ride in urban cities is the lowest among all other types of cities, while rural cities had the highest average fare per ride.

## Summary 
First, I would suggest to the CEO from the data that there should be a higher total number of drivers in rural cities to increase the total amount of rides in the city in order to increase total fare for rural cities. The average fare per driver in a rural city is around fifty five dollars, which is very high and is too high of a discrepancy with urban drivers fare. Second, I think that that the CEO should raise the average fare per ride in urban cities because it can help Pyber gain more monetary profit. Last but not least, I suggest that the CEO decreases the average fare per driver for rural cities because I think there is too high of a difference between the average fare per driver in rural cities versus urban cities.
